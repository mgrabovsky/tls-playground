# TLS Playground

This repository contains code samples demonstrating how to establish a TLS connection
and submit a simple HTTP request to a remote server in the C language. The samples
each use a different TLS-capable library: [OpenSSL 1.1.1][openssl],
[GnuTLS 3.5.19][gnutls] and [mbed TLS 2.13.0][mbedtls].
